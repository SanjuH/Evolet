                    Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application the content, design and how you interact with it.
                    <br>this is done with three codes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for marking up text in order to turn it into a web page.Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application.<br>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web.
                    <br><br>
                <li>
                    Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language that is widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.<br>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application.
                    <br>A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end.<br><br>
            </ul>

                    <li>
                        Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices which means developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should be able to run on different devices powered by Android.
